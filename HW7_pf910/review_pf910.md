The plot is clear and communicates the information clearly, the selection of color, size of labels, titles and ticks is good.
The information represented is accurately without modifications and is clearly being truthful, on the other side is not totally clear if this plot is only representing a single and specific residential building in NYC or is an average of all residential buildings.
I am wondering how functional this plot can be because by the number of observations it is easy to identify that dogs are more common just by looking at the numbers.
